# 256 Games

## Skip this part if you don't want to read any nonsense, and go straight to "How to run" section.

Hi, I'll be your guide towards this journey.

Apparently I'm not good enough in Python coding yet. I don't know if we should write lamdpa or lambda and I believe generators exist only to provide energy.

What I'm good at, is talking sometimes too much and being creative, especially using basic tools.

So here we are, welcome to (trumpets) 256 games written in pygame, using as little images as possible.

Basic idea is to create simple games, like those "Cars" you played on this old, junky console. Maybe a little bit better and faster, but still simple as it was. And create 256 games of this kind. You might notice a little bit of cheating (for example, Cars when you move in X axis and Cars with Y axis are two different games. Just as in good times. Yay!)

### Reasons

1. Because my github seems pretty empty.
2. Because I want to be game developer someday.
3. Because I believe, that if I want to write 256 games I will be forced (!) to actually write nice, clean code, with good design patterns. Either this, or I am lost.
3. Because it trains my brain, which got a little bit lazy and needs more challenges.
4. Because I'm curious what might happen with those games later. Use Pandas, opencv, ML? There is insane amount of possibilities. (Actually just those right now, I'm not good yet at Django or Flask - but hey, it would be amazing to see how you can use it in simple game)


## How to play

'pip install pygame'
'python main.py'

You don't need anything more (yet) so there is no more detailed manual. I just really wanted someone to read my README one day.

In Reasons, number "3" appears twice.

### Credits
Music is credited in both game and "credits" file, and images are mine (well the heart isn't yet, but I don't have Photoshop with me).
